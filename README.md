# Homepage

A responsive homepage made using HTML/CSS for an assignment in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-advanced-html-and-css-homepage).<br>You can view the live webpage [here](https://lukatsanavabtu.github.io/homepage/).

## What I Practiced While Working On The Project

- Making diferent layouts for different screen sizes;
- Media queries;
- Mobile-first responsive design;
- `max-width`, `min-width`, `max-height`, `min-height`;
- Relative units (`vw`, `vh`, `%`);
- Experimented with `object-fit`.
